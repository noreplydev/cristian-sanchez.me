# Introduction
When it comes to installing operating systems, arch linux is one of the hardest ones (is not harder at all) to install. The problem is that there are many steps to follow and if you are not careful you can end up with a broken system. In this post I will show you how to install arch linux in a simple way `step by step`.

But first, let's talk about some requirements I will reccomend you to have before installing arch linux.

# Requirements
Is not neccesary to have a expert knowledge about the next terms, but I will reccomend you to have a basic knowledge about them.

**UEFI**: Is a firmware interface that is used to boot the operating system. If you have a new computer, you probably have UEFI.

**BIOS**: Is a firmware interface that is used to boot the operating system. If you have an old computer, you probably have BIOS.

**Filesytem**: Is a method for storing and organizing files and directories. The most common filesystems are: ext4, ntfs, fat32, etc.

**Partition**: Is a logical division of a hard disk that is treated as a separate unit by the operating system. The most common partitions are: primary, extended, logical, etc.

**Swap**: Is a space on a disk that is used when the amount of physical RAM memory is full.

**Basic linux commands**: Is a set of commands that are used to interact with the operating system. The most common commands are: ls, cd, mkdir, rm, etc.

**Nano/Vim**: Is a text editor that is used to edit files from the terminal.

There are more terms but these ones is important to understand since in this post we will not explain them in depth. Anyways, I will share some links where you can learn more about them in the bottom of the post.
