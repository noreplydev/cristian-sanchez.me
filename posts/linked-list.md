# Data Structures series
Let's start this data structures series with one of the most basic data structure. We will be talking about Linked Lists, what they are, how they work, and how to implement them in JavaScript. 

# What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list (it can also contain the reference to the previous node).

A linked list should look like something like this. Where each letter represents a node and the lines represent the links between the nodes.
